AI Application for videosurveillance

This code implements a multimodal video search and retrieval system, leveraging CLIP for embedding generation, FAISS for efficient similarity search, and a local Language Model (LLM) for result validation and opinion generation. Here's a detailed summary of the approach:

# 1. Video Clip Processing and Embedding Generation:

Input: A folder containing video clips (MP4 files).
Object Detection: The code uses a YOLOv3 model to detect objects within video frames. This provides semantic information about the video content.
Keyframe Extraction: Keyframes are extracted from each video clip to represent its visual content.
Multimodal Embedding:
Visual Embedding: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is used to generate visual embeddings from the extracted keyframes.
Semantic Embedding: Sentence transformers are used to create semantic embeddings from the detected objects and context.
Combined Embedding: The visual and semantic embeddings are concatenated to form a comprehensive multimodal representation of each video clip.
Storage: The generated embeddings and associated metadata (filenames) are stored in JSON files.

# 2. FAISS Indexing:

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): FAISS is used to create an efficient index of the video embeddings.
Index Creation: A flat L2 distance index is created, which is suitable for searching high-dimensional embeddings.
Embedding Indexing: The visual embeddings from the video clips are added to the FAISS index.
Persistence: The FAISS index is saved to disk for future use.

# 3. Text-Based Video Search:

User Query: The user enters a text query describing the desired video content.
Text Embedding: The CLIP model is used to generate a text embedding from the user's query.
FAISS Search: The FAISS index is queried using the text embedding to retrieve the most similar video embeddings.
Result Retrieval: The filenames of the top-k matching video clips are retrieved based on the FAISS search results.

# 4. LLM Validation and Opinion Generation:

LLM (Language Model): A local LLM (Ollama with Mistral) is used to validate and provide opinions on the search results.
Prompt Engineering: A carefully crafted prompt is used to instruct the LLM to:
Rank the retrieved video clips by relevance.
Explain why certain clips are irrelevant.
Summarize the content of relevant clips.
Provide an overall opinion on the search results.
LLM Processing: The retrieved video filenames and the user's query are passed to the LLM.
Response Generation: The LLM generates a detailed response that includes its analysis and opinions.

# 5. Streamlit User Interface:

Text Input: The user enters their search query through a text input field.
Search Button: A "Search" button triggers the video retrieval process.
Video Display: The retrieved video clips are displayed within the Streamlit interface.
LLM Output: The LLM's response (analysis and opinions) is displayed below the video clips.
Error Handling: The UI includes error handling for missing video files and cases where no relevant videos are found.

In essence, the system combines:

Visual and semantic analysis of videos: to create robust video representations.
Efficient similarity search: to quickly retrieve relevant videos based on text queries.
LLM reasoning: to provide context, validation, and opinion on the search results, improving the user experience.
